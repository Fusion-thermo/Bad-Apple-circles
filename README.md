# Bad-Apple-circles

No edges, only circles !
Between 300 and 7000 circles per frame.
Sometimes it flickers, it's because I only use circles on the less present color (less than 50% of the screen).
It can show shading and little leaves which is pretty cool.


The code is commented.
I modified the code from https://github.com/xnx/circle-packing and used the frames from https://github.com/CameronChoy/BadAppleFLSL/tree/master/BadApple (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-gFajE5UEM)
