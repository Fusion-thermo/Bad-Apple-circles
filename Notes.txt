42% filling : around 3000 circles.
Before modifying the number of circles in function of the filling : 61h estimated. After : 36h.
So now I have the same density of circles for each frame.

If more than half the frame is black we reverse the color in order to draw white circle on black background.
Strangely doesn't seem to improve the time (on the same set of frames).
